# Project: Create You Own Image Classifier
This is the project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python course.In this project, you train a image classifier on a dataset using PyTorch, then convert it into a command line app.

# Required Setup
You should have CUDA available on you local computer, otherwise it will likely run very slow and won't work well.You should also have all the python packages installed on your local environment.I recommend you install later PyTorch version that like 2.9.1+cu128 so cuda is available.
